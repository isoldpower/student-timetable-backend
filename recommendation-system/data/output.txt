ANSO 1085 Human Origins (3)
Archaeology, defined simply, is the study of humanity through its material manifestations.
                              It is also about trying to understand something of our common humanity by examining
                              the physical traces of the people of the past. These traces don't have to be old,
                              and you don't have to dig for them; the vast majority of archaeological work, however,
                              does involve digging up old materials people have left behind. The key, then, is the
                              method. How do you deal with the material? What kind of conclusions can be drawn from
                              it, and how do you arrive at them? We will examine the scope and usefulness of archaeology,
                              as well as the ethics of doing it at all.

                              work theory, practice, policy, research, and the diversity of populations are integrated
                              in exploring the knowledge, values, and skills base of the social work profession.

ANSO 2690 Food and Culture (3)
This course explores the role that games play in our society -- why we like to play
                              games, and what the games we play tell us about ourselves and our sense of the world
                              around us. Looks at games from the perspective of several theoretical traditions:
                              as rational exercises meant to impose order, as a cultural product to tell certain
                              narratives, and as interactive exercises that create community and shared experience.
                              Examines the rising trend in "gamification" -- the usage of games toward pro-social
                              activities like learning and education, and in addressing social and behavioral problems.
                              Investigates if games can -- or should be -- accurate representations of our social
                              worlds, and how we can go about using them to tell sociologically interesting stories.

ANSO 2720 Introduction to Measurement and Statistics (3)
In this course we will discuss the history of food consumption and its connection
                              to cultural values and attitudes, as well as issues such as power and control. We
                              will delve into a variety of social issues and food/environment related topics, including
                              human health.

ANSO 2760 Urban Studies (3)
Designed to aid the student in learning how to "make sense" of a body of numbers:
                              how to summarize and extract information from numbers; how to detect, measure, and
                              use relationships between variables; and how to use statistical aids to the decision-making
                              process. Course covers descriptive statistics, correlation and regression, and inferential
                              statistics such as the t-test and analysis of variance. GCP Coding: (QL).

ANSO 2790 Asians in America (3)
The course examines space as an object of social inquiry, paying attention to the
                              cultural, political, and economic processes that transform space into meaningful place.
                              Building upon this theoretical foundation, it explores some central themes and concerns
                              in the study of urban spaces, in particular, the “city” as cultural construct, the
                              “city” as the site and object of local and global social struggles, and the “city”
                              as part of the cultural imagination of the social, inequality, justice, and the “good
                              life.” The “city” is an object of contention, complexly entwined with class, gender,
                              race, ethnicity, and the “market.” This course will equip students to understand,
                              among other topics, the formations of ethnic and racialized “ghettos,” suburbanization,
                              policing of space, global cities, and urban community politics. GCP Coding: (SSHB) (CRI).

ANSO 2850 Introduction to Research Methods (3)
This course examines comparatively the experiences, histories and cultural worlds
                              of Asian communities of different national origins and identifications of the United
                              States. "America" in this course indexes the contestations (accommodation, resistance,
                              contradiction) around national and racial-ethnic belongings. It introduces the historical,
                              political, cultural and economic processes that shape Asian and Asian American community
                              and identity formation. Rather than static, discrete and bounded, Asian and Asian
                              American identities and cultural-politics have been mutually constituted through histories
                              of colonialism and war, economic globalization, and increasing transnational traffic,
                              and the tightening and loosening of national borders and rules of citizenship. We
                              will examine in this course the colonial and Cold War origins of Asian American diasporic
                              communities; the culture and politics of racial formation; commodification of racialized
                              and gendered bodies, emphasizing the centrality of labor politics; boundaries of citizenship;
                              transnational movements; and struggles for power and recognition. GCP Coding: (GLBL) (CRI).

ANSO 2890 Health, Illness and Power (3)
Research is at the heart of the behavioral and social sciences. This course will cover
                              the basics of quantitative and qualitative research design. In addition, students
                              will be provided with the means to critically analyze and assess the ethics of research
                              findings. Lastly, students will be given the opportunity to develop a research proposal.

ANSO 2950 Community Practicum (3)
How are health and illness experienced across different social and cultural contexts?
                              Do they mean the same things across different communities? This class examines how
                              our understandings and experiences of health and illness are structured by factors
                              such as access to care, social and cultural values, local and global knowledges, availability
                              of medicines and distribution of resources. In particular, we look at how these experiences
                              intersect with broader structures of power and inequality. Rather than approach health
                              and illness as strictly biomedical constructs, we analyze how they are shaped by wider
                              political, economic, cultural and moral considerations. GCP Coding: (PNW) (ETH).

ANSO 3560 Theories in Anthropology and Sociology (3)
NGOs, or non-governmental organizations, have become powerful actors in the global
                              arena. Their participation in development processes has shaped how we think about
                              poverty and suffering, and what we do about these issues. NGOs have inspired new ways
                              to think about the relationship between the state, citizens and globalization. As
                              a result, we are now confronted with new forms of power and governance. This class
                              will analyze NGO practices across global contexts, paying special attention to what
                              these organizations do and the effects of their actions. Topics may include microfinance,

                              experiences with the criminal justice system, for offenders, victims, and criminal
                              justice professionals; the role of gender in the lives of male victims, offenders,
                              and criminality will also be analyzed. The course will analyze gender and social control
                              incorporating both traditional and feminist theoretical accounts of conformity, deviance,
                              and crime.

CRIM 3500 Criminal Procedure and the Constitution (3)
This course emphasizes a sociological approach to understanding the law. Instead of
                              learning about the "law on the books," or specific legal codes and how to apply them,
                              we will focus on "law in action." We will address how social factors, such as race,
                              class, and gender, shape the law and how people from different social backgrounds
                              have varying experiences with the law. We will also address how the law both affects
                              and is affected by social change.

CRIM 3610 Independent Reading Course (1-5)
This course examines the relationship between the US Constitution and criminal law.

                              such as traffic stops and the search of suspects. Additionally we examine how Constitutional
                              Laws affect such areas as the gathering of evidence, pre-trail preparations, the rights
                              of the accused, and the punishments available to the criminal justice system. Students
                              will gain a firm foundation in how Constitutional principles undergird modern law
                              enforcement, legal, and corrections paradigms.

EDEX 3010 Intro to Chess in Education (3)
Unfortunately, until now computer chess experts and human players, for different reasons,
                              have generally worked independently from one another through sharing reciprocal benefits
                              of the other. Literature in the field of chess computers has been difficult to properly
                              translate to the everyday player without losing its depth of scientific research,
                              algorithms, and proper understanding. The outcome has included trivial chess software,
                              overly-simplified manuals, and anecdotal but too technical of works. Conversely, in
                              today's world, chess software has become essential for a professional chess player
                              to increase their learning and performance abilities. This course brings together
                              the world of chess and computer science. Students who take this course will learn

                              Introductory chess topics will highlight the creation of the game, basic gameplay,
                              educational implementation, journalism and commentating, historical and political
                              significance, integration of technology, psychology, competition, and chess as a community
                              developing tool, all through a globalized perspective. Students will begin developing
                              their own chess portfolios to track academic knowledge, passionate projects, and professional
                              progress.

EDEX 3020 Psychology of Chess (3)
This course will focus on the intersections of history and chess from the 6th Century
                              through the Present time. This is not a class where you will learn how to play a basic
                              game of chess. Instead, we will focus on meaningful periods in time, such as the necessity
                              of Indian rulers to learn how to fight against Central Asian nomads, Napoleon's Strategy,
                              the Cold War, Proving Women's Intellect, and Artificial Intelligence: Man versus Machine.
                              Current and past chess books focus on how the game has changed over time, and who
                              has played, but they do not look at History with the ribbon of chess woven through
                              it. This course will be of special interest to students who may not want to become
                              professional chess players, but who are interested in how a board game can be so influential
                              throughout history!  Prerequisite: EDEX 3010.

EDEX 3025 Chess Strategy: War, Business, and Chess (3)
Psychology of Chess is a course designed for students to reflect on their strengths
                              at the chessboard and beyond. Chess has been researched in psychology since at least
                              1984 by Alfred Binet, one of the inventors of the IQ test. Chess is an objective game
                              of perfect information, but human play brings subjectivity in skill and psyche, thus
                              impacting the result. Researchers have been interested in the cognition of chess players
                              for over a century, ranging from understanding intelligence to abnormal psychological
                              disorders. Students who take this course will be introduced to psychological tests,
                              chess psychology, positive psychology, research areas, chess for mental health, and
                              sports psychology. Prerequisite: EDEX 3010.

EDEX 3030 Chess and Artificial Intelligence (3)
This course will introduce students to the concepts of strategy and strategic thinking
                              as demonstrated through the classic game of Chess. Strategic thinking is essentially
                              'critical thinking applied to completion'. A critical thinking framework for making
                              decisions forms the basis of the course, which is then applied and demonstrated through
                              Chess as Chess provides the necessary 'competition' for critical thinking to become
                              'strategy' vis-á-vis a rival competing for a mutually-exclusive outcome - win or lose.
                              Prerequisite: EDEX 3010.

EDEX 3040 Service Learning Project: Community Chess (1-3)
Since the inception of the first computer chess program, Turbochamp, in 1948, by Alan
                              Turing and David Champernowne, the world of chess has forever changed. The Chess and
                              Artificial Intelligence course is designed to highlight the historical and cultural
                              impact of globalized chess technology, the fall of people in the rise against machines,
                              the struggle of cheating in competition, improvements of educational access, chess
                              and Esports, the Pre-Covid 2020 Chess Boom, and the rapidity of learning by creating
                              neural networks. Students who take this course will gain insight into the role of

Video Game Production is the culmination of all a student's prior experience, focusing
                              on the entire production process of games. Students meld the skills and knowledge
                              gained in previous courses to design and develop a game within a collaborative environment.
                              This course requires students to work on teams to release a game online (via digital
                              means such as Itch or the App Store) within the 15-week course timeframe. During that
                              time, each student-led team pitches their game concept, designs a milestone map, then
                              develops, markets, and ultimately releases their game. As each experience is dramatically
                              different, this course may be taken a total of three times for credit. Prerequisite: Permission of the instructor.

HIST 2380 The American West: Film, Fiction, and Reality (3)
This course examines the lives of women in America during the years from the Revolution
                              to the present day. We will investigate the ways in which women have functioned as
                              agents of historical change, as their lives and actions have both impacted and been
                              impacted by major historical events. Particular attention will be paid to the changing
                              nature of the family, changes to the work women did (both paid and unpaid), and the
                              involvement of women in social and political reform. We will also investigate the
                              diversity of women's experiences in the past. Just as today, "women" cannot be spoken
                              of as a monolithic block; women throughout America's history have been divided and
                              often had difficulty uniting across lines of class, race, and ethnicity. GCP Coding: (ROC) (CRI).

                              exploration through the 20th century. Particular attention will be paid to the late
                              19th century, when western expansion was at its peak. We will examine western expansion
                              from the perspectives of both American settlers and the Native Americans already living
                              in the region. Students will learn about the diversity of the West throughout its
                              history, and how the "Old West" of cowboys and gunslingers was only part of the story.
                              We will also discuss the reasons why the popular perception of the "Old West" has
                              lingered as a romanticized image in American culture. GCP Coding: (ROC) (CRI).

                              We will focus on the development of medical models to treat disability in the nineteenth
                              and twentieth centuries, the responses of persons with disabilities and the evolution
                              of the disability rights movement in the United States and globally since the 1970s.

Examines the nature of evil and its impact on victims and perpetrators; differences
                              between genocide, democide, ethnocide and other forms of mass violence; the interaction
                              of psychological, sociological, cultural, and/or political roots of evil, human cruelty,
                              mass violence and genocide; Staub's theory of evil and the application of this theory

                              the question of what can be done to prevent human cruelty, mass violence and genocide.

HRTS 4500 Human Rights Field Experience (3)
Human rights standards are often incorporated into the civil law of nations, but not
                              always -- and often incompletely. Business practice is generally required to conform
                              to national law, but businesses operating internationally are also under pressure
                              to conform to international human rights standards. The course examines conformity
                              of national and international business with relevant human rights standards and the
                              pressures leading toward greater conformity or increased violation.

HRTS 4600 Overview (3)

ILC 1000 The Power of Languages (3)


ILC 1070 Intensive Introduction to Language: Level I (1-3)
Language is a central part of what makes us human. It allows us to identify with one
                              another and form communities but at the same time, it can also create obstacles and
                              tensions between people. The objective of this course is to understand how language
                              intersects with external factors such as race/ethnicity, gender, and sexual orientation,
                              as well as how these interactions reveal differential power relations. For example,
                              how does the domination of certain languages alter global relations and cultures?
                              How do languages impact the way we perceive the world around us? Students will approach
                              language as a phenomenon from multiple perspectives and acquire a global understanding
                              of its universal dynamics and mechanisms. No background in linguistics is required
                              for this interdisciplinary course. GCP Coding: (SSHB) (INTC).

                              culture or language. Through single or multiple themes, students will learn about
                              the historical and sociopolitical contexts for areas where the target culture differs
                              significantly from U.S. culture and develop their intercultural competence skills.

                              formulas, and culturally specific terms that do not exist in English, that would help
                              them establish contact with the people of the target region. May be repeated for credit
                              if content differs. GCP Coding: (GLBL) (INTC).

ILC 2610 Intermediate Language: Readings (1-3)
Like language, food is a culturally loaded commodity tightly linked to cultural identity
                              and used and needed by all human communities. Peoples and cultures develop their gastronomies
                              using staple ingredients autochthonous to their regions. Food items move, travel,
                              are shared, traded or exchanged, and enter in contact with foreign cultures that integrate
                              and acculturate them to their own gastronomy and cuisine thus creating new cultural
                              hybrids. Globalization imposes and facilitates this particular cultural exchange more
                              intensely and faster than ever. This course explores the intrinsic relationship between
                              food, language and identity: how food, like linguistic practices constitutes one of
                              the most powerful vehicles of cultural identity. This course will be taught in English.
                              Topics may vary. May be repeated for credit if content differs.

ILC 3000 Study Abroad: Advanced Level I (1-13)

                              the department chair. Prerequisite: ILC 2100 or equivalent.

ILC 3550 Language Practicum (1-6)
An exploration of literature in a comparative context: what is it, how does it function
                              and what value does it offer both local and global communities today? How does literature
                              transcend cultural and linguistic boundaries and how is it defined by these? Students
                              will develop skills that will help them interpret, both in writing and verbally, literary
                              texts. They will also examine the production of these literary artifacts and the ways
                              in which gender, sexuality, race, geography and history impact literary production
                              and reception. By looking at literatures from at least two different cultural traditions,
                              either in the original languages or in translation, students will consider theories
                              of translation and the concept of untranslatability. Topics differ and may look at
                              one genre across cultures and historical periods or may examine themes across multiple
                              genres such as world literature, postcolonial literature, ecocriticism, etc. May be

Tourism is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon. It is of economic importance to
                              most countries and a major source of foreign exchange for much of the developing world.
                              It is also the most intimate of all industries, bringing culturally diverse people
                              together in close association, and placing large numbers of tourists in sensitive
                              situations and socially/ecologically fragile places. In addition, tourism plays a
                              significant role in conflicts that arise over how people and their places are represented

KEYS 4005 Global Gender Rights (3)
Water concerns are among the most important and controversial global issues of the
                              21st century. Examples of current issues include water shortages impacted by political
                              systems; difficulties for vulnerable populations in relation to water-borne diseases;
                              and impacts of water pollution of ecological ecosystems. This course examines the

KEYS 4007 School on a Shoestring: Educational Inequities (3)
Slavery is illegal globally, yet more people are enslaved/ trafficked today than they
                              were at any point in history. There are approximately 27 million slaves in the world,
                              which is more than the total number of people taken from Africa during the three centuries
                              of the transatlantic slave trade. Work performed by slaves has become an important
                              part of the global economy; many of the products we use and consume, from children's
                              toys to clothes and electronic goods, are made from materials and components that
                              have been produced by slaves. This course begins with a brief history of slavery in
                              the ancient world through to the present time. The local, national and global economic,
                              political, social, cultural and legal policies, structures, institutions, conditions
                              and practices (or lack thereof) that sustain contemporary slavery and the trafficking
                              of human beings will be examined. The question of what can and must be done to eradicate
                              slavery will be addressed throughout the course.

KEYS 4008 Leading From Where I Am (3)
Applied real-world opportunities: Documenting and understanding one's own slavery footprint will help students identify
                              ethical dilemmas in counteracting modern day slavery in every day life. Students will
                              have an opportunity to interact with local organizations involved in combatting slavery
                              and human trafficking and may also participate in transcribing interviews for the
                              Bijlmer Project.

KEYS 4009 Through the Looking Glass: Discovering Identity, Purpose and Path (3)
Although architects, artists, scientists and other community members have designed
                              ingenious, innovative solutions to meet needs, we have not fully addressed how these
                              solutions affect interconnected systems. What are the dynamics of these systems? How
                              can observing the systems in nature to determine form and function drive a sustainable
                              future? How do we take a systems-based approach to design from the micro to macro?
                              How do we design individual products? How do we design cities and buildings to provide
                              for the health and well-being of its citizens?

KEYS 4010 The Democratic Process (3)

This course will examine the status of women and women's rights locally, nationally
                              and globally. This includes analysis of the economic, political and cultural policies,
                              structures, institutions, constraints and conditions that affect the status and rights
                              of women. Possible topics addressed may include: violence against women, women's health,

                              an ethnic identity, a physical dwelling, or a valued and meaningful position in society.
                              We will examine all dimensions of place starting at the highest levels of place such
                              citizenship and working our way down to the highly individual. Along the way we will
                              investigate how many other social, cultural, environmental and political problems
                              intersect with our understanding of place and the various meanings attached to it.

KEYS 4014 Social Movements and the Impact of Technologies (3)
Education is the foundation for economic, social, and personal success, and yet for
                              millions of children primary education is inadequate or unavailable. In this course,
                              educational inequities affecting elementary and secondary students and the systems
                              contributing to these inequities will be examined at the local, national, and global
                              levels. Students will consider populations particularly vulnerable to educational
                              inequities and evaluate the unique effects they have on these populations. Students
                              will explore possible solutions to these issues at the local, national and/or global
                              levels.

                              their strengths in order to develop a distinctive philosophy of leadership. Students
                              will be given the opportunity to develop their leadership through an assessment of
                              their own strengths, projects to develop leadership and learn how to exercise leadership
                              in teams, and reflections on these experiences.

KEYS 4018 Plays and Concerts and Inks, Oh my!: Encountering Art in Our Communities
                              (3)
At this point in college, we are either firming up who we are or our lives are turning
                              upside down. Identity is a fluid, ever changing aspect of who we are, what we want
                              to be, and what we value. We see it in how we view others and how others view us.
                              In this class, we will examine theories of personal, cultural, and societal identities.
                              Through this, we will move forward into examining what we love to do, what we are
                              good at, and how we can use this to make a positive difference in our communities.

                              and international levels. This course will challenge students to define what a democracy
                              is, and what cultural and political developments make democracy possible. It will
                              give students the chance to reflect on their own responsibilities as citizens, and
                              to put their insights into practice as they work as part of a team to advocate for
                              a particular issue or position of their choosing.

KEYS 4021 Citizen Science (3)
Applied real-world opportunities: In groups, students will choose a local or state issue that is important to them.
                              With the guidance of the instructor, they will design a plan to advocate for a particular
                              position. Possible activities could include participating in a political campaign,
                              mounting a petitioning campaign, or lobbying local or state lawmakers. At the conclusion
                              of the project, students will reflect on what effect their participation in the democratic
                              decision-making process had.

KEYS 4022 Living Generously (3)
This course considers the relationship between language and power, particularly in
                              the way global languages like English enable populations and societies in positions
                              of power to protect their political, literary, philosophical and religious interests.

KEYS 4023 Critical Issues in Global Health (3)
Experiential component: Students will design and present a conference addressing issues discussed within
                              the course using social media to maximize audience outreach and impact.

KEYS 4024 Family Violence: A Global Perspective (3)
Is space merely a container of social action? Is the city merely the background, the
                              context, of urban research? In this interdisciplinary course, we will examine the
                              city as cultural construct and the city as the site and object of local and global
                              social struggles. Students will explore themes and concerns in the study of urban
                              spaces/places, including how the city has informed imaginations of the social norms,
                              inequality, justice, and the good life. For example, the city has nurtured modernist
                              dreams of the perfectible society, and conversely, has fed rabid fears of social disorder
                              and violent contagion. The city is an object of contention, complexly entwined with
                              notions of class, gender, race, and ethnicity.

KEYS 4025 Political Activism in Sports
Applied real-world opportunities: The experiential component will be tailored to fit the urban problem being investigated
                              by the class. Some possibilities include: shelter and soup kitchens, work with refugees,
                              work with local government agencies, interviews with stakeholders.

                              public relations organizations; improving their interviewing skills; and preparing
                              their résumés. Prerequisites: Public relations major and senior standing.

PBRL 4960 Global Strategic Communication Campaigns (3)
The culmination of the public relations curriculum, students in this course operate
                              as a public relations agency, serving the needs of an actual client. The course offers
                              students the opportunity to apply learned theories to developing a complete public
                              relations campaign. Emphasis is placed upon concept, strategy, tactics, and presentation
                              skills. Prerequisite: PBRL 1010.

PHIL 1000 Introduction to Philosophy (3)


PHIL 1010 Introduction to Critical Thinking (3)


PHIL 1200 The Meaning of Life (3)
Introduces a broad spectrum of topics in philosophy, such as knowledge, reality, freedom,
                              morality, and art. The emphasis is not only on what is contained in these topics,
                              but also on how to think critically about them. GCP Coding: (ROC) (CRI).

PHIL 2000 Making Decisions (4)
Emphasizes identifying the techniques of critical analysis and analyzing arguments
                              in a variety of short essays, most of them not by professional philosophers. Gives
                              special attention to educating students to distinguish between their own beliefs as
                              to the truth or falsity of a claim and the validity of the arguments offered in support
                              of that claim. GCP Coding: (CRI) (WCOM)**.

PHIL 2010 Informal Logic (3)
This course explores what makes life meaningful from several perspectives, including
                              Western and Eastern philosophical perspectives, theistic and atheistic perspectives,
                              and social and political perspectives from different cultures both inside and outside
                              the United States. Commitment to cultural values creates differences that often cause
                              hostilities. This course aims to help students understand cultural values other than
                              their own in order to promote an appreciation of and tolerance for cultural differences.
                              GCP Coding: (GLBL) (INTC).

PHIL 2020 Formal Logic (3)
There are significant tensions between how we ought to decide (or how decision theory
                              tells us we ought to decide) and how we in fact decide. This course reviews ideal
                              methods for decision making, ways that decision makers habitually fall short of the
                              ideals, and how decision theory can be applied in ordinary life to make more rational
                              decisions and achieve better outcomes. Topics include mental and social impediments
                              to good decision making, probabilities, risk, games, and bargaining. GCP Coding: (QL) (OCOM).

PHIL 2080 Topics in Philosophy (3)
Introduces the study of reasoning, including the nature of argument, deductive and
                              inductive inference, meaning and inference, validity, hypotheticals, syllogisms, and
                              the identification of fallacies. Emphasizes reasoning in a natural language and arguments
                              in practical contexts with minimum use of symbolic notation.

PHIL 2110 Introduction to Ethics (3)
Studies techniques of deductive inference in a symbolic notation, including propositional
                              calculus and some operations with quantifiers. Covers theory of logic, including such
                              topics as axiomatization, rules of inference, the distinctions between use and mention
                              and validity and truth, semantic interpretations, completeness, and consistency. Cross-listed
                              with MATH 1580 and COSC 1580.

PHIL 2200 Philosophy of Happiness (3)
Study of text or topic in a special area of philosophy. Contents and methodology on
                              an introductory level. May be repeated for credit if content differs.

PHIL 2300 Social and Political Philosophy (3)
A topical introduction to ethics. Topics to be covered may include: the nature of
                              ethical reasoning, duty, and obligation; excuses, mitigating circumstances, and personal
                              responsibility; conflicts between obligations and between duty and self-interest;
                              conflict between personal and community moral standards; and the objectivity or subjectivity
                              of values. Replaces BUSN 2110. GCP Coding: (ROC) (ETH).

PHIL 2320 Contemporary Moral Problems (3)
This course is a philosophical exploration of concepts, values, experiences of --
                              and contexts for -- happiness and its pursuit. The course centers on the question
                              of what happiness is as both an internal experience, as part of one's "inner world,"
                              and as an external, social and cultural, reality that includes but also extends beyond
                              one's subjective inner world. We will draw on two different theoretical orientations:
                              a descriptive orientation, which addresses the question what is the nature of happiness?;
                              and a normative orientation, focused on the question what role does happiness play
                              in a good life? To enrich our understanding, we will draw on a variety of readings in
                              philosophy and the social sciences.

PHIL 2330 Philosophy and Technology (3)
Introduces philosophical issues and concepts of political thought from antiquity to
                              the present day through examination, from different perspectives, of democracy, sovereignty
                              and authority, justice, liberty, and the relationship between the individual and the
                              state. Cross-listed with POLT 1070. GCP Coding: (ROC) (CRI).

PHIL 2340 Bioethics (3)
Examines the opposing positions typically taken in discussions of contemporary moral
                              problems, such as euthanasia, the death penalty, pornography, animal rights, and world
                              hunger. The focus is on developing and critically analyzing reasons used to support
                              a moral position. GCP Coding: (SSHB) (ETH).

PHIL 2350 Introduction to the Philosophy of Leadership and Management (3)
Philosophical consideration of technology, including such issues as how technologies
                              embody values, technological determinism, consequences of technological choices, and
                              how technologies can be helpful or hurtful. Typically focuses on one or a related
                              group of technologies.

PHIL 2360 Environmental Ethics (3)
This course explores the ethical issues that arise with changes in medical technologies
                              and health care policies. Students explore the philosophical concepts of autonomy,
                              duty, justice, and care as they apply to patients and physicians. Topics covered may
                              include stem cell research and cloning technologies, organ transplantation, experimentation
                              on animals, prenatal diagnosis and abortion, euthanasia and assisted suicide, access
                              to experimental treatments, and allocation of scarce resources. GCP Coding: (SSHB) (ETH).

PHIL 2370 Feminist and Gender Theory (3)
Leadership and management are enormously consequential activities. We all want both
                              to have good leaders and managers and to be good leaders and managers, given the opportunity.
                              This course looks at leadership and management through the lens of social philosophy,
                              asking at the most general level, "How shall I move my group in the right direction?"
                              The course takes up several important conceptual and normative issues in organizational
                              management and leadership, and will also look at practical implications. Classic philosophical
                              texts will be considered as well as more recent work in philosophy and in management
                              and political theory. GCP Coding: (SSHB) (OCOM).

PHIL 2390 Philosophy of Sex and Love (3)
This course considers how one ought to live, given what we know (and are learning)
                              about ourselves in the physical and natural world. Students explore the values, rights,
                              responsibilities, and obligations relevant to environmental problems such as climate
                              change, air pollution, waste disposal, land degradation, water depletion and pollution,
                              threats to biodiversity, and population growth. GCP Coding: (PNW) (ETH).

PHIL 2400 Human Rights and Animal Rights (3)
Feminism. Few words provoke the amount of anger, excitement, fear, celebration and
                              qualification that the "F" word does. In this course students learn several theories
                              of feminism, critically analyze them, and apply them to concrete social and political
                              problems.

PHIL 2510 The First Philosophers (3)
For all the time we spend organizing our lives around sex and love—online and off—most
                              of us spend surprisingly little time thinking about what “sex” and “love” mean. We
                              rest on platitudes about love, while asking very little about what it is, and what
                              it should be. Sex is on most people’s minds, but not philosophically; what counts
                              as good sex is often narrowly crafted by those of dominant social statuses, while
                              alternatives are obscured by taboos and silence. This course will help students think
                              about these terms from a variety of perspectives. Students should come to class with
                              an open mind and willingness to evaluate Western, traditional, and/or mainstream views
                              of sex and love through atheist, queer, feminist, anti-racist, and decolonial perspectives.

PHIL 2520 Philosophic Classics: Early Modern Europe (3)
Many advocates for human rights see humans as possessing a unique and special value
                              which places them in a separate moral category from other animals. Some argue that
                              'rights' is a uniquely human concept which cannot be applied to other species. In
                              this class, we will examine the concept of rights as it applies to human and other
                              animals in an effort to determine who is entitled to rights and what rights they are
                              entitled to.

PHIL 2525 The Scientific Revolution and The Enlightenment (3)
This class is an exploration of the very beginnings of Western philosophy, an invitation
                              to hear the authentic voice of its creators. We will catch the tremendous energy and
                              excitement of this new intellectual creation at the moment of its birth, as we study
                              famous Ancient Greek thinkers such as Heraclitus, Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle,
                              as well as other, later thinkers from Hellenistic times and the Roman Empire. Our
                              main theme is "the art of living." We will investigate the ways that the earliest
                              thinkers considered philosophy to be "an existential choice of a way of life" (as
                              Pierre Hadot says)-a choice about how to achieve human happiness and an intense joy
                              in living, using Reason as our guide. GCP Coding: (ROC) (WCOM).

PHIL 2540 American Transcendentalism Pragmatism (3)
Early modern Europe, an era of profound intellectual, scientific, religious, and philosophic
                              change, produced philosophic works with enduring influence on Western culture. This
                              course reviews selected classics, familiarizing students with famous thinkers, their
                              thoughts, and their methods. Prerequisite: PHIL 2510 is recommended. GCP Coding: (ROC) (WCOM).

PHIL 2550 Existentialism (3)
An introductory survey of the main ideas of leading Western thinkers from the 17th
                              to the 19th centuries-an era of profoundintellectual, scientific, religious, and philosophical change. This period offered
                              discoveries that went smaller, larger, and farther than humans had ever experienced
                              before. As a result, intellectuals confronted questions about the role of experience
                              in knowledge, about what things are, about our place in things, and about the limits
                              of what we might know or say. Emphasis on the historical development of philosophical
                              positions, especially the articulation of views in reaction to the ideas of others,
                              the interactions between "philosophy" and "science," the development and consequences
                              of the mechanical philosophy, and the veil of perception. GCP Coding: (ROC) (CRI).

PHIL 2580 African American Philosophy (3)
Each civilization contributes a unique intellectual culture that characterizes the
                              values and aspirations of its people. This course explores some intellectual impacts
                              and influences of the unique contributions of American philosophers. An introductory
                              study that combines the historical and cultural setting of inquiry into the nature
                              of experience, truth, goodness, and society by nineteenth-and twentieth-century American
                              philosophers, including Emerson, Thoreau, James, Peirce, and Dewey, and their influences
                              on later philosophies in the United States. GCP Coding: (ROC) (INTC).

PHIL 2610 Intermediate Reading (2-4)
Combining art, film, and literature, this course on existential philosophy aims to
                              show that philosophy is relevant for life. Students explore existentialism-one of
                              the most important traditions of recent thought, which gives primacy to our "lived
                              experience "through a consideration of such vital concepts as "being-in-the-world,"
                              "authenticity," "bad faith," and "radical freedom." We look closely at what gives
                              meaning to life and how to be a free individual. We give special attention to the
                              moral and political implications of existentialism, particularly its implications
                              for understanding gender and race (i.e., the nature of identity).

PHIL 3000 Proseminar (1)
This course will explore the history of African American philosophy in the United
                              States. It will focus on the continuity of African thought and how it carries through
                              to today. We will discuss topics such as the history of racism, the prison industrial
                              complex, education, the role of the Black church, slavery, and Black Feminism. We
                              will read thinkers like Frederick Douglass, W.E.B. Du Bois, Booker T. Washington,
                              Sojourner Truth, Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, Angela Davis, and many more.

                              the defensibility of those commitments and claims, and film as a mode of presentation
                              for philosophic ideas. May be repeated for credit if content differs.

PHIL 3220 Transforming the Self (3)
Raises philosophical issues surrounding the activities of producing and appreciating
                              works of art. Sample topics: the theory of art, the relationship between art and other
                              human institutions, standards of judgment in art, how works of art are meaningful
                              and true, and the relationship between judgments of value in art and judgments of
                              moral worth.

This course explores the philosophical dimensions of religious belief and practice.
                              Topics include: the nature of religion and of religious and spiritual experience;
                              the problem of religious diversity; the nature of the Religious Ultimate, and evidence
                              of its existence; evil and religious belief; scientific rationality and religious
                              belief; religious naturalism; faith and rationality; continental philosophy of religion
                              (God as "the impossible"); and the interrelation between religious, spiritual, and
                              moral values. The course draws on writers and texts located within or in relation
                              to various world religious traditions, especially Buddhism, Hinduism, and Abrahamic
                              Monotheism (Judaism, Islam, and Christianity) and Humanism.

PHIL 3310 Philosophy of Science (3)
This course explores a neglected dimension of the Western Philosophical Tradition
                              -- philosophy as a transformative, spiritual practice. The goals of this transformational
                              process can range from resolving personal and existential issues, such as the fear
                              of death, to attaining liberation or freedom. The core of transformational philosophical
                              practice is not the attainment of abstract, theoretical knowledge for its own sake,
                              but rather the subordination of the pursuit of knowledge to the development of wisdom
                              and the resolution of human problems. Students will focus on a variety of ways of
                              doing transformative philosophy and construct their own philosophical handbook, containing
                              helpful and liberating insights and instructions.

                              Simone de Beauvoir (3)
Gives students an opportunity to consider what it means to engage in philosophical
                              thinking from a position of "the other" in relation to the mainstream Western tradition.
                              Students are introduced to influential texts in feminist philosophy and identify interlocking
                              threads of connection between various oppressed groups, aiding analyses of sexism,
                              heterosexism, racism, classism, ableism and imperialism.

PHIL 3400 Human Rights and the Environment (3)

                              include household, sexual, reproductive, and medical technologies, the development
                              of standards and classification systems, the organization of businesses and states,
                              race, the environment, and the future of feminist philosophy and technoscience.

PHIL 3420 Philosophy of Race and Ethnicity (3)
Simone de Beauvoir was one of the twentieth century's most important and interesting
                              thinkers. In this class, we focus on her major work, The Second Sex. We read a good
                              deal of this text, and we examine its relevance for contemporary life. We also examine
                              Beauvoir's literary efforts, including She Came to Stay and All Men Are Mortal, in
                              order to see how she illustrates her philosophy. We consider de Beauvoir's response
                              to both existential and political concerns, including the nature of freedom, the struggle
                              for recognition from the Other, the situation of women in the western world (both
                              past and present), and how to confront one's own mortality.

PHIL 3590 Theories of Human Rights (3)
Examines the ideological and practical overlap between human rights frameworks and
                              environmental sustainability. What does it mean to have a "right" and to whom or to
                              what does that notion apply? Should human beings have a right to a sustainable environment? Could
                              it make sense to say that non-human animals and other living beings, such as trees
                              and rivers, have rights? Students analyze specific cases as well as the effects of
                              racism, sexism, classism, and nationalism on people's physical health and the health
                              of their environments.

Examines the historical development of theories of human rights and their relation
                              to civil liberties; international law; social organization; and different conceptions
                              of community, individualism, and the state. Also examines the most significant human
                              rights documents in their historical context. May focus on specific cases and questions
                              of current concern. Cross-listed with POLT 3590. Prerequisite: POLT 1070, PHIL 2300 or GNST 1600.

PHIL 4450 Internship (1-6)
This course is an investigation of various philosophical questions concerning the
                              nature of mind, consciousness and self. The course travels a winding path from the
                              classical mind-body problem (How does mind relate to matter?) to issues concerning
                              the relationship of consciousness to biological life, the environment and brain (Is
                              consciousness in our heads?) and the relationship of technology and culture to the
                              mind (Can technology "extend" our minds, in some sense?). In the last section of the
                              course, we will think about questions concerning the self, hallucination and dreaming
                              (Is the self real or an illusion, like a dream?). We'll address these issues through
                              reading and discussing both theoretical-discursive readings in the philosophy of mind
                              and the philosophy of neuroscience, and various case studies from Oliver Sacks. We
                              will also view two films that place mind, consciousness and self in surprising and
                              puzzling dramatic, aesthetic and philosophic contexts.

PSYC 3225 Holocaust (3)
Community psychology views knowledge and understanding of the social context in which
                              individuals and families live as necessary to understanding those individuals. From
                              this framework, it is not possible to effectively intervene with an individual who
                              is experiencing problems without also understanding and intervening in aspects of
                              the community that are involved in the identified problem. Community psychology has
                              four main components: prevention and competence promotion, community building with
                              citizen participation and empowerment, human diversity, and strong research to evaluate
                              programs. Among key values in the field of community psychology are individual wellness,
                              the importance of a sense of community, and social justice. Prerequisite: PSYC 1100 or permission of the instructor.

                              perspective. Issues explored include: the question of what enabled individuals collectively
                              and individually to perpetrate the Holocaust, the nature of extreme prejudice, the
                              psychology of propaganda, the impact of extreme victimization on the victim (during
                              the Holocaust, upon liberation, and in later years), and the question of what enabled
                              some individuals/groups/countries to actively become involved in resistance while
                              others remained passive bystanders and others sympathizers/collaborators. The roles
                              that psychology, psychologists, and psychiatrists played during the Holocaust are

                              and behaviors, and can influence their interactions on both interpersonal and intergroup
                              levels. Utilizes psychological theory to understand the role that religion, faith,
                              and spirituality play in different areas of human activity such as health and the

PSYC 4950 Senior Assessment (1)
At first glance, psychology appears to be a highly disjointed discipline. However,
                              psychology is unified through its historical traditions and systems of thought. This
                              course will explore the roots of modern psychological thought and methodology. We
                              will trace these roots from their origins in philosophy and the natural sciences through
                              the early schools of psychology and on into its current form. In addition to learning
                              about the major schools and systems of psychology (e. g., Functionalism, Structuralism,
                              Gestalt, etc.), we will explore how cultural and political forces shaped the development
                              of various psychological theories. We will also examine the lives and works of the
                              men and women whose work created psychology's foundation. Prerequisites: PSYC 1100, PSYC 2825, and 18 credit hours of psychology; or permission of the instructor.

                              and how these have impacted religions. Examples are the spread of and increased access
                              to liberal values, the rise of the nation state, changes in subjectivity/identity,
                              colonialism and science. We will end the course with making a prognosis on the future
                              development of religions in the globalized world. The course will be based on reading
                              recent scholarship on these issues, our analysis of specific cases and various individual

                              for credit if content differs.

RELG 1060 World Religions (3)
This course raises some of the largest and most perplexing questions human beings
                              are capable of asking themselves about the meaning and purpose of existence. Perhaps
                              one of the dilemmas we must each face is that we are capable of raising questions
                              for which we cannot seem to find definitive answers. But this course understands that
                              the word "answer" doesn't simply refer to a set of beliefs about the world but instead
                              also refers to a response to the world's condition. This personal search for meaning
                              and patterns of direction in our life is sometimes called "spirituality" and comes
                              equipped with a multitude of definitions. We will explore various responses which
                              have been offered by significant religious traditions, as well as raise the larger
                              question as to whether the word "spirituality" needs to be separated entirely from
                              the world of religious language. This course will help do some self-exploration, clear
                              thinking about your own assessments of "answers" previously offered and explore issues
                              which may not find neat and tidy answers, you are invited to do so in a focused manner.

RELG 1080 Thinking Through Religions (3)

RELG 2032 Global Christianities (3)
This course examines the association of violence with religion. Although it focuses
                              almost exclusively on contemporary events, the historical antecedents for the use
                              of violence to promote religion or the use of religion to justify violence come from
                              the first historical records.

RELG 2050 Religion and Human Values (3)
This course will not examine those antecedents but will provide analytical value for
                              students who examine human history or look to explanations of contemporary human behavior.

                              The eighth case (and the eighth week) will be provided by student projects which are
                              meant to be shared with the entire class. The course provides the maximum amount of
                              substantive information so that students might make data driven comparisons to contemporary
                              and historical incidents of religious violence. GCP Coding: (SSHB) (CRI).

                              be introduced to new ways of looking at Christianity and how it is practiced in a
                              wide range of cultural contexts.

The course will consider different religious and philosophical perspectives on ecojustice,
                              defined as the right relationship of humans with one another and with nature; it will
                              help students understand the place and responsibility of institutions/systems and
                              human beings in relation to this issue. The course will show how Religions source
                              of cultures and contributes to our understanding of human nature, and how religious teaching
                              and holy books (along with literature, art, music and philosophy) have given us the
                              concept of human values and have thus influenced human societies. GCP Coding: (ROC) (ETH).

RELG 2080 Introduction to Western Religions (3)
According to the UN Global Compact and the UN Alliance of Civilizations, religion
                              in the workplace is becoming an increasingly important issue for companies. This is
                              driven by demographics, an increased role in religion in public life and the globalization
                              of operations. This course explores contemporary issues and global perspectives regarding
                              religion in the workplace: religious diversity (including the non-religious) in organizational
                              cultures; employee rights, discrimination and legal remedies; differences between
                              religion and spirituality in the workplace; globalization and interreligious encounters;

RELG 2101 Science Fiction and Religion (3)
This course offers a general introduction to Judaism, focusing on questions of Jewish
                              identity and culture or cultures, especially in the contemporary United States: What
                              makes someone Jewish? Are there beliefs, practices, or sacred narratives which all
                              Jews have in common? How (if ever) do people become Jewish, and how (if ever) do they
                              stop being Jewish? Why do most American Jews accept Jewish Buddhists but reject Jewish
                              Christians? And what does it mean when someone claims to be “culturally Jewish?” Viewed
                              through the lens of Jewish identity, students will learn about topics ranging from
                              Jewish ritual and liturgy to the role of women in Jewish life to the stereotypes of
                              Jews in Western art and literature. The course will also address ways in which Jewish
                              identity has influenced and has been influenced by other world religious traditions.

RELG 2150 Existence and Meaning (3)
This course will review the wide variety of belief systems found in traditional tribal
                              societies. Throughout most of human history, people have lived in small-scale societies
                              which have followed religious practices commonly integrated into their ecosystems.
                              Horticulturalists, pastoralists and hunter-gatherers have been commonly dependent
                              upon their relations with other animals and the food sources available in the ecological
                              niche in which they live. The belief systems of these peoples have provided fertile
                              ground for the development of the major religions found in the world today.

                              selected genres or examples of literature. Typically considers literary themes in
                              religious terms, or vice versa, and the ways in which creative writings and religious
                              ideas amplify and interrogate each other. May be repeated for credit if content differs.

RELG 2201 Islam and the State (3)
Explores significant relationships between science fiction and the world's religions.
                              Examines how science fiction uses religious themes to develop plot, character and
                              action, and how understanding religious themes can illuminate and amplify the message
                              and values of science fiction. GCP Coding: (ARTS) (INTC).

                              of human existence and our roles as meaning-makers and interpreters of inherited meanings,
                              especially those of religious teachings. May be repeated for credit if content differs.

RELG 2400 Religion and the Arts (3)

                              Sometimes cross-listed with HIST 2210.

RELG 2401 Religion and Media Culture (3)
This course examines the intersection of Islam, politics, and government. Believers
                              in Islam view their faith as a comprehensive guide to life - but should this include
                              politics and government? If so, how should Islam be applied to the State, the modern
                              structure of governance? Is Islam compatible with democracy? With capitalism? With
                              socialism? With national identities and material power? In this course, we study various
                              theoretical interpretations of these issues and gain exposure to the diversity of
                              thought on how Islam should be applied to the State. We also look at the history of
                              Islamic governance - in particular, the institution of the Caliphate. Finally, we
                              conduct four case studies of contemporary Islamic governments and see how well theory
                              is put into practice: Saudi Arabia, Iran, Taliban Afghanistan and the new "Islamic
                              State" founded by the al-Qaeda offshoot ISIS, or ISIL in parts of Iraq and Syria.
                              We will also ponder the role of sectarianism in the politics and governance of the
                              Muslim world today. Students have an opportunity to research other cases of contemporary
                              Islamic governance via the mandatory research paper.

                              with particular attention to literary, historical and critical issues and how these
                              texts have remained sacred or normative within their tradition. May be repeated for
                              credit if content differs.

RELG 2410 Religion and Science (3)
Studies the important interrelationships of the arts and world religions. The use
                              of the visual and allied arts for communication and edification has been a primary
                              concern both positive -- e.g. the glorification of Rome during the counter-reformation
                              -- and negative -- e.g. the Islamic proscription of images -- for all religions. May
                              be repeated for credit if content differs. GCP Coding: (ARTS) (INTC).

RELG 2411 Religion and Scientific Theory (3)
How have changes in the way we communicate knowledge transformed how we practice and
                              see religion? For instance, how has the ability to reach virtually anyone anywhere
                              through internet or television changed the way Christian churches do missionary work?
                              And how, on the other hand, have our religious traditions played a role in shaping
                              the new media of the modern period? For instance, how has the Judeo-Christian notion
                              of the soul as distinct from the body influenced the way we contact each other from
                              afar through machines? How have Western beliefs about the possibility of contact with
                              the dead influenced the creation of the telephone? In this course we will explore
                              these questions and others, namely the role of various media in religious practices,
                              experience, beliefs and identities, and vice versa. Using cross-cultural media sources
                              we will analyze this interaction in written media (books and newspapers); radio; television;
                              and films; and finally in digital media based on written, audio and audiovisual sources.

RELG 2420 Religion and Culture (3)

RELG 2431 Ecology and Spirituality (3)
The development of scientific thought and the origin of scientific theory have been
                              tightly woven with the refinement and change of theology and religious belief. It
                              is impossible to deal with one without reference to the other. This course will look
                              at how scientific thought and theory has changed and how that has influenced religion.
                              Themes will include the universe, the planet earth, evolution, quantum physics and
                              several other areas of scientific theory.

RELG 4400 Spiritual Paths and Classics (3)
This course will focus on the introduction, spread and practice of Christianity in
                              Africa. Many times when we talk about Christianity in Africa, there is a tendency
                              to portray it as a product of colonialism. In this course we discuss Christianity
                              as an African religion. We examine the religious innovations that have shaped what
                              can be aptly called African Christianity. From its initial introduction in the 2nd century
                              and its adoption as the Ethiopian State Religion in the 4th century AD to today, Christianity
                              in Africa has proved to be a potent force for change, conflict and a source of empowerment
                              for many. This course will help you make sense of these developments.

WGST 2030 Introduction to LGBTQ Studies (3)
Feminism. Few words provoke the anger, fear, frustration, celebration, and qualification

                              learn several theories of feminism, critically analyze them, and apply them to concrete
                              social and political problems. Theory will be used as a tool for clarifying and demystifying

                              - between queer theory and other social and cultural theories. Rather than understanding
                              queer theory as a singular or coherent school of thought, students will problematize
                              queer theory as a field and a mode of analysis. Students will discuss theoretical
                              issues in a quest to develop an understanding of the politics of queer sexuality.

                              women's political participation and presence in public office. We will also discuss
                              various governmental policy arenas that have been of particular interest to feminist

WGST 2275 LGBTQ Families (3)
This course examines men and masculinities through a critical lens, looking carefully
                              at an institutionalized system of behaviors and beliefs that is assumed to be a natural
                              phenomenon (as well as culturally universal and historically eternal). The goal of
                              the course is to reach an understanding of various masculine behaviors, myths, ideologies,
                              and experiences; to comprehend the relationship between masculine practice and social
                              power; and to delineate choices for future directions in the behavior and belief systems
                              of individual men and the society at large. The course is necessarily interdisciplinary,
                              and will utilize the tools and methods of sociology, anthropology, psychology, and

                              looking at the history of marriage and family with primary attention to the issue
                              of "same-sex" marriage. This course will consider perspectives from social scientists
                              and social critics who question the functionality of marriage. Moreover, a human rights
                              framework will be used to discuss the idea of marriage and family "rights." Students
                              will examine several historical and contemporary case studies, and will explore different
                              theories about the role and functioning of the institutions of marriage and family.

This course examines the lives of women in America during the years from the Revolution
                              to the present day. We will investigate the ways in which women have functioned as
                              agents of historical change, as their lives and actions have both impacted and been
                              impacted by major historical events. Particular attention will be paid to the changing
                              nature of the family, changes to the work women did (both paid and unpaid), and the
                              involvement of women in social and political reform. We will also investigate the
                              diversity of women's experiences in the past. Just as today, "women" cannot be spoken
                              of as a monolithic block - women throughout America's history have been divided and
                              often had difficulty uniting across lines of class, race, and ethnicity.

WGST 2550 Gender, Culture and Leadership (3)
In this course, students will explore the historical, social, cultural and political
                              contexts of the lives of bisexual women, men and trans folks. The focus will be on
                              people's lives in the late nineteenth, twentieth and early twenty-first centuries,
                              examined via autobiographical and scholarly accounts. Students will attend to the
                              diversity of people's experiences, particularly with respect to race/ethnicity, social

                              ethnicity, class and sexuality play in defining leadership and power. From an intersectional
                              feminist perspective students will examine inequities in paid and unpaid workforces,

This course will examine contemporary issues related to gender and sexuality in the
                              foundation and leadership of social justice organizations. We will examine the social
                              justice organization's role in promoting such issues as women's and LGBTQ global political participation,
                              economic opportunities, access to education, messages about sexual and gender violence,
                              reproductive justice, and amnesty. Students will be challenged to "put their passions
                              into practice" by applying their increased knowledge of social justice organizations
                              to the creation of their own organization, including a final presentation that could
                              be made to potential funders. We will also focus on aspects of governance unique to
                              feminist organizations. GCP Coding: (SSHB) (WCOM).

WGST 2680 Transnational Feminism (3)
Women still face substantial obstacles in every area of political, social, and economic
                              life, yet most people continue to deny that gender inequality is a serious problem.
                              The legal system perpetuates this denial as well, and historically has attempted to
                              discount or justify gender discrimination. This course will focus on the past and
                              current developments of laws, programs, and institutions which impact gender issues.

                              is perpetrated against them, this course will investigate the history of violence
                              against women, the current status of this violence, and the community response. In
                              this course, women will be studied as victims, survivors, activists, advocates, and,
                              due to the systemic nature of this struggle, experts on the topic. The feminist theories
                              applied in the course include women and children at the center of the circle, gender

WGST 4330 Global Sex/Gender Systems (3)
Many sources in popular culture would have us believe that feminists don't like families,
                              and are anti-marriage and anti-children. This course will examine these myths by 1)
                              reading excerpts from classic first-wave and second-wave feminists that address issues
                              about women and families; 2) reviewing the changes in family life that feminists have
                              sought and successfully won (e.g., increased lesbian and gay parenting, fathers' increased
                              participation in child-rearing, more recognition that domestic labor is not merely
                              "women's work"); 3) exploring contemporary feminist perspectives on families; 4) looking
                              toward the future and asking what remains to be done to improve families for women.

                              in the United States. How are the expectations of females and males structured differently
                              across time and space? What approaches do other cultural systems take to alternative
                              sexualities? Under what circumstances is coercion or violence a central structuring
                              process in maintaining a sex/gender system? Cross-listed with ANSO 4300.
